# Docker Images

This repository contains data for generating Docker images of Eurex Clearing AMQP interfaces. It covers:
- FIXML Interface
- FpML Interface
- Margin Calculator Interface
- ERS Interface
 
All interfaces have separate versions for Simulation and Production environemnts. Data for individual brokers are stored in separate branches. Docker images are build using Travis-CI and are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ecmi/).

More information about how to use these images can be found in this article on the [Effective Messaging blog](http://blog.effectivemessaging.com/2015/06/docker-images-for-developing-and.html).
